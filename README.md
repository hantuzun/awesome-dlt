In order to keep up with emerging Distributed Ledger Technologies that are trying to bring a reasonable compromise or a solution to the scalability trilemma, I've created this list. 

Please open pull-requests for the projects you think that are worthy to be included here. If you think a project better be unlisted, consider opening an issue so that we could discuss the project's merits.
